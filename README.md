# Pokemon Storage

This was originally written in Python (https://github.com/maxoakes/pokemon-storage), but doing byte-level operations in a dynamically-typed language was a wild choice, so I am migrating to C# since I know it about as much as I do Python.

Currently only supports a MySQL database that stores the vulkeen-pokemon database. One day I will add support for the sqlite version, which I should have done in the first place but w/e.

## Instructions

1. Rename `appsettings.json.example` to `appsettings`.
2. Add the connection string to the database that stores the vulkeen-pokemon database.
3. ???
4. Profit

Once I get this fleshed out more I will add a lot more detailed instructions.
